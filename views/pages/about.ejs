                Shiguma Bar & Resto is a premier place among sushi lovers in the region. The restaurant is held in high regard by its patrons and peers alike. Shiguma Bar & Resto
                was established in 2011 by Rino Deru Rozario, a Japanese chef with several years of professional experience. Rino, from an early age, was fascinated with Japanese
                cuisine. He is naturally gifted with culinary skills and senses. He pursued his passion and enrolled in one of the top culinary schools in Japan.
              </p>
              <p>
                After graduating from the culinary school, Rino worked under the guidance of world-renowned chefs of his time in different countries. His experience allowed him to
                learn from the best and hone his culinary skills further. Having worked for more than seventeen years in leading restaurants around the world, Rino opened Shiguma
                in Philippines after falling in love with the country.

                      My husband is a picky eater and only prefers food prepared with traditional methods. He nitpicks at almost every restaurant we go to. However, I have never
                      seen him complain at Shiguma, which is a testament to the quality of their food. We visit the restaurant at least once or twice a month.

                      My friends and I are foodies, and we love trying out new restaurants. We visited Shiguma a few years ago for the first time. We fell in love with the taste
                      and freshness of their sushi preparations. I have been a regular since then and can affirm that we have never tasted better sushi anywhere else except at
                      Shiguma in BGC.

                      I work at managerial level in an international company, and we often receive clients and visitors from Japan. We take quite a few of them to Shiguma, and
                      every one of our guests has been impressed by the authenticity of their sushi dishes.

                      I have been visiting Shiguma since its early days. I love the authentic taste of the sushi dishes and the ambiance at the restaurant. While my wife and I
                      prefer the traditional sushi dishes, our fast-food savvy kids love the modern sushi items on their menu, which are healthier, nutritious, and tasty!
